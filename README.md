FTX trading:

A secure HFT platform to trade Johnny and Tofu coins; created my take of a binary b-tree storage engine in Rust+C; coded
a 4kb-aligned zero-copy pager that bypasses the OS and maps bytes directly from SSD to program RAM; my pager is 10,000x faster in
data transfers than the standard library’s; data heavily encrypted; WAL to ensure absolute integrity and recovery
